# 3dModelBrowser
3d Model Browser based on WebGL

This is a simple 3d Model Browser based on WebGL.
for the usage of previewing&exporting simple 3d Object views as reference for further painting/drawing/processing.
the shaders still remain uncomplete 
also the camera controls are not ready.

all Files under /gltf should be replaced with the Model files in form of GLTF2.0, or any extened json File that contains necessary structures of a GLTF2.0 file.
(along with associated sources)

all Files under /shaders should be replaced with any arbitrory Vertex/Fragment Shaders source code in Form of GLSL.
